What About a Poem?

by Monica Johnson

It was about what they felt when 
They laugh or sang
What they saw
What they hated or loved
They where either here or there
Their lines fed concepts a script 
of life and as robots they could 
sense
as if they where people
It exposed
Their hidden web
With rhyming lyrics.
Your lamp was your light 
and 
you couldn't throw it out.
They'd go throw an event in
their lives like the act was 
directing them and it was their guide.
They'd have a vibe like it touched 
everything in the environment.
If it left one
Thing out it was then just 
valuated of highlighted
Amongst the other words
What did Poems do?
I remember poems?
It could have been
the subject of 
the first thing they mentioned 
and it could have just been that and repeat. 
And some experiences would chorus out like that song was of much influence.
