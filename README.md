Outer Earth Urgent Report (OEUR)
A giant tar leak emerged for the factory.
After a long quick sand like suction we lost some sources food, tents, tools and survival pamphlets.
Residents dropped in a phase of wrapping themselves in the private air globes. 
Some globes are missing mobility. 
Headquarters is now sending out rescue crew to pull out residents from the after math.
We need crew to raise then all out.
A restoration crew is now already excavating tar and separating it from the ground in \to cleaning compartments.
Please send in the advanced cleaning supplies right away.
